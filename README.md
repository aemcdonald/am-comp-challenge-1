Static Comp Challenge
---
## Objective
This project was designed to practice HTML and CSS during my third week of Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. I was given a comp to follow for the page layout but was free to choose colors, images and icons. The base layout is pictured below:

Base Layout:

## Outcome

I decided to make a travel blog of different trips that I have taken in the past. I added an icon in the upper left corner of each card that is designed to be a "like" feature that users can click & enlarges when a mouse hovers over it.
